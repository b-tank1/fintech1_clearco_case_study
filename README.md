homework assignment #1 for fintech bootcamp. Case study on Clearco.

## Overview and Origin

* Clearco was co-founded as Clearbanc in 2015 by Michele Romanow from Canada’s Shark Tank (Dragons’ Den), Andrew D’Souza, Ivan Gritsiniak, Charlie Feng, and Tanay Delima.

* The company's main idea is to provide alternative financing to e-commerce startups different than traditional venture capital.

* They’ve raised $700M to date from investors including Oak HC / FT, Highland Capital, Emergence, Founder’s Fund, and Inovia.

## Business Activities

* Typical venture capital involve seizing an equity stake in the company to serve as collateral and investment upside. Clearco looks to fill this gap by providing alternative equity-free funding for early-stage e-commerce startups by adopting a revenue sharing model where the investee pays back the investment plus a fixed rate interest as revenue is earned, like royalties.  

* The company's target customer is early stage e-commerce startups with some proven track record of profitable ad-spend and growth. Also, they are probably also not mature enough yet to support a fixed-term bank loan, which makes the revenue sharing model more preferable.

* Clearco offering differentiates itself from traditional VCs and banks by providing the upfront capital needed without compromising the founders' equity ownership and without enforcing a fixed monthly payment. The founders have a track record of operating and investing in other e-commerce business, and hence must have some distinctive analytical process for suitable customers. In addition, Clearco may be able to bring industry connections and expertise to the table to entice some founders to choose them over other financing options.

* Clearco must utilize a machine learning algorithm which is auto-generating the loan offers to potential startup founders. This algorithm must also be continuously tuned by their data science team to optimize their return on risk. Their tech stack, according to Stackshare, consists of typical web development tools like Javascript, Node.js, HTML5, MongoDB, Python, Google Platform, etc. They also are integrated with other platforms like Google analytics, Paypal, Stripe, Shopify, etc. that are likely utilized by their customers.

## Landscape

* Clearco is basically operating in the lending business, except targeted only to e-commerce startup founders who are looking to borrow money to fuel business growth.

* Clearco is one of the game changers in the startup financing domain. Traditional startup financing has typically involved taking equity in the company, which may not always be in the best interest of the founder.

* There is nothing really proprietary about Clearco's business model, and hence they have attracted a fair number of competitors in this space like Wayflyer and Uncapped, both of which were founded in 2019.

## Results

* Clearco has invested over $3 billion to date in over 7000 businesses. Part of their mission, aside from helping founders retain equity, is to eliminate gender and racial bias when deciding which businesses to invest in. They claim to have invested in 25x women led business than traditional VCs, which definitely augments their brand. 

* Relatively to some of its competitors, Clearco was earlier to the game and has a lead on the total number of companies funded and total amount invested. Uncapped has funded around 500 companies thus far, and Wayflyer has funded around 1500 (~$850 million dollars). Having a larger existing customer base gives Clearco more training data to fine-tune its AI and more partnerships to enable between its customers. As long as they don't lag behind in the new customer acquisition rate, they should be able to maintain their current lead.

* Shopify is an additional competitor to be wary of. Given that many small e-commerce merchants will choose Shopify as their platform, they may likely opt to use Shopify's merchant service loans. Shopify has a much larger repository of e-commerce merchant data to train its AI on, and hence may likely present a better loan offer.

## Recommendations

* The business proposition of offering equity-free, revenue-sharing based debt financing is non-proprietary. This is evidenced by a multitude of competitors offering a similar service. Hence, the differentiator must be to offer additional value to the e-commerce founder to entice them to choose Clearco's service over other providers. 

* Clearco currently offers dashboards with analytics and KPI tools to help its customers monitor their business health and benchmark against competitors in the industry. Service can also include consulting services such as supply chain analysis, introductions to networks and competitive landscape analysis.

* It would be also great if Clearco could build a partnership with a reputable patent and IP protection firm. Investing in IP protection without splurging on an unproven product is a common goal among all startups, and thus should be a somewhat common need among most of of Clearco's exisiting customers. If Clearco can bundle their offer with a very market competitive rate for IP service, some merchants could definitely be swayed by that offer.

* Implementing this idea mainly requires deep legal expertise around IP laws. In terms of technology, using AI to automate parts of the patent drafting process could offer great time savings around a somewhat tedious and potentially mentally exhausting exercise. However, these domains likely drift too far outside of Clearco's current core competencies. Therefore, exploring a partnership to offer this service is probably more ideal.
